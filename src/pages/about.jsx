                    Hello, my name is Amber. This is my personal website, where I’ll be introducing myself in detail.</p>
                    <p>
                    I was born in China and completed my education there through university. </p>
                    <p>
                    Afterward, I worked in Shanghai for 3 years. In 2024, I chose to come to Ireland to further my studies.</p>
                    <p>
